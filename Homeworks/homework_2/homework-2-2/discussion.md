- The shape of the hard sphere potential's B2v vs. T plot is constant because for values of r < sigma, the potential is infinite, making U(r)/(kb * T) go to infinity regardless of temperature. When r > sigma, the potential is zero, making U(r)/(kb * T) go to 0 regardless of temperature. because of this, there is no place in the equation to calculate B~2v~ where temperature can affect anything.
- The B2v vs. T plots for both the square well potential and the lennard jones potential begin negative but increase with temperature because they both have regions where the value of U(r) is finite and non zero meaning the temperature is actually relevant.
